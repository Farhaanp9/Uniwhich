The client that approached me, Mr.ABC, is a college student that studies in the United states of
America and is currently doing his major in pure mathematics. Living in a foreign country, he
started a small business in his dorm room of making sandwiches and selling them to the other
students in his dorm as a side venture of his own. The problem for Mr.ABC is that the orders
that he receives his hard to organize and set up with his college work schedule. With the stress
of college work, getting more customers for his sandwiches is hard. He requires an organized
system for people to order his product with certain requirements at specified hours.

Thus, the way to solve this problem is with an IT solution. So I decided to build and develop a website to solve the problems that Mr.ABC has.
